## MemoZoo
***
### Overview
This project aims on recreating a memory game application on computer, based on the simple and famous memory game which is usually played using paper tiles. An example of the game would look like [this](http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-60941595948465/animals-wooden-memory-game-4.gif).

### Objectives
- A simple game for children to enhance memorizing skilles, broaden their perceptions about animal world as designed with bright colors and animated animals. 

### Functionality 
- The Game play
    - A preset board has all of its tiles faced down. In order to win the game, all tiles need to be faced up.
    - To open up all the tiles, users need to find all of the pairs of similar tiles. If the two tiles have the same image, the tiles stay flipped; else, they turn the face down again. A move is called when there are 2 tiles clicked.
- Main features:
    -- A 4x4 grid board (the size can be adjust to change the level of difficulty). Note that the total number of tiles need to be even.
    -- A reset button reinitializing and randomizing the tiles down-faced the board.
    -- Click functionality: When a tile is clicked, it flips over and shows the image.
