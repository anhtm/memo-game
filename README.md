### Objectives
To build a simple memory game application on computer, designed with bright colors and animated animal images. This is aimed towards young users (i.e: Children aged 2 - 6) to enhance memorizing skills and broaden animal perceptions.
An example of the game would look like [this](http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-60941595948465/animals-wooden-memory-game-4.gif).

### Functionality 
- Game rules:
    - A preset board has all of its tiles faced down. In order to win the game, all tiles need to be faced up.
    - To open up all the tiles, users need to find all of the pairs of identical tiles. If two tiles have the same image, the tiles stay flipped; else, they turn the face down. 
    
- Main features:
    - 4x4 grid board (the size can be adjust to change the level of difficulty).
    - Reset button: reinitializing and randomizing the tiles down-faced the board.
    - Click functionality: A tile flips over and shows the image when clicked.
